## What Does This App Do?

ShoreExplorer helps cruise passengers plan their time at each port of call. You tell it:
- Which cruise ship you're on
- Which ports you're visiting (and when you arrive/depart)
- Who's travelling (solo, couple, family)
- How active you want to be
- How you want to get around (walking, taxi, public transport)
- Your budget

It then uses AI to generate a complete day plan with:
- A circular route starting and ending at your cruise ship
- Timed activities with descriptions and cost estimates
- Weather-appropriate suggestions
- An interactive map showing your route
- Links to book paid activities
- Packing suggestions and safety tips

---

## What You'll Need Before Starting

Before you begin, you'll need to install some software on your computer. Don't worry - each tool below has a simple installer, and we'll walk through them one at a time.

| Software | What It Is | Where to Get It |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Node.js** (v18 or newer) | Runs the frontend (the part you see in the browser) | [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) |
| **Yarn** | Installs frontend code packages | Installed via Node.js (see Step 1) |
| **Python** (v3.9 or newer) | Runs the backend (the server that handles data) | [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **MongoDB** (v6 or newer) | The database that stores your trips and plans | [mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) |
| **Git** | Downloads the project code | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) |

You will also need one API key:

| Key | What It's For | How to Get It |
|-----|--------------|---------------|
| **Google Gemini API Key** | Powers the AI that generates your day plans (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) | Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), sign in with your Google account, and click "Create API Key". Free tier: 15 requests/minute, 1500 requests/day. |

> **No other API keys are needed.** The weather service (Open-Meteo) and maps (OpenStreetMap) are completely free and require no sign-up.

---

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Open the **Terminal** app on your computer (Mac/Linux) or **Command Prompt / PowerShell** (Windows) and follow each step below.

### Step 1: Install Required Software

#### Install Node.js
1. Go to [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts (accept all defaults)
4. Verify it installed correctly by typing this in your terminal:
   ```
   node --version
   ```
   You should see something like `v18.x.x` or `v20.x.x`

#### Install Yarn
Once Node.js is installed, install Yarn by typing:
```
npm install -g yarn
```
Verify it worked:
```
yarn --version
```

#### Install Python
1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the installer for your operating system
3. **Important (Windows only):** During installation, tick the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**
4. Run the installer and follow the prompts
5. Verify it installed:
   ```
   python3 --version
   ```
   You should see something like `Python 3.11.x` or `Python 3.12.x`

#### Install MongoDB
1. Go to [mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Select your operating system and download the installer
3. Run the installer (accept all defaults)
4. MongoDB should start automatically as a background service

**To check MongoDB is running:**
```
mongosh --eval "db.runCommand({ ping: 1 })"
```
You should see `{ ok: 1 }`. If you get an error, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-common-issues) section.

#### Install Git
1. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
2. Download and install for your operating system (accept all defaults)

---

### Step 2: Download the Project

Open your terminal and navigate to where you want to store the project (e.g. your Desktop or Documents folder):

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

Then download the project:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url> shoreexplorer
cd shoreexplorer
```

> Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual GitHub URL of this repository.

---

### Step 3: Set Up the Backend

The backend is the server that handles your data, talks to the AI, and fetches weather information.

#### 3a. Create a Python virtual environment

This keeps the project's packages separate from the rest of your computer:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### 3b. Activate the virtual environment

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You'll know it's working when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal line.

#### 3c. Install Python packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3d. Create the backend environment file

You need to create a file called `.env` inside the `backend` folder. This file tells the backend where to find the database and AI service.

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
cat > .env << 'EOF'
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
DB_NAME=shoreexplorer
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
EOF
```

**Windows (manually):**
1. Open Notepad (or any text editor)
2. Paste the following lines:
   ```
   MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
   DB_NAME=shoreexplorer
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
   ```
3. Save the file as `.env` (not `.env.txt`) inside the `backend` folder
   - In the "Save as type" dropdown, select "All Files"
   - Name it exactly `.env`

**Now replace the placeholder values:**

| Variable | What to Put | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| `MONGO_URL` | The address of your MongoDB database. If you installed MongoDB locally with defaults, **leave this as-is**. For MongoDB Atlas, use your connection string. | `mongodb://localhost:27017` or `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/` |
| `DB_NAME` | The name of the database. **Leave this as-is** unless you want a custom name. | `shoreexplorer` |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key. Replace `your-google-api-key-here` with your actual key from Google AI Studio. | `AIzaSyC...` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of allowed frontend URLs for CORS. **Leave as-is for local development**. For production, set to your actual frontend domain(s). | `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001` or `https://yourdomain.com` |

> **Where do I get my Google API Key?**
> 1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
> 2. Sign in with your Google account
> 3. Click **"Create API Key"**
> 4. Copy your key (starts with `AIza...`) and paste it into the `.env` file
> 5. Free tier limits: 15 requests per minute, 1 million tokens per minute, 1500 requests per day

---

### Step 4: Set Up the Frontend

The frontend is what you see and interact with in your web browser.

Open a **new terminal window** (keep the backend terminal open) and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/shoreexplorer/frontend
```

#### 4a. Install frontend packages

```bash
yarn install
```

This will take a minute or two as it downloads all the required code packages.

#### 4b. Create the frontend environment file

Create a file called `.env` inside the `frontend` folder.

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
cat > .env << 'EOF'
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001
EOF
```

**Windows (manually):**
1. Open Notepad
2. Paste this single line:
   ```
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001
   ```
3. Save as `.env` inside the `frontend` folder (same method as before - "All Files" type, name it `.env`)

| Variable | What to Put | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` | The address where the backend server runs. **Leave this as-is** for local development. | `http://localhost:8001` |

---

### Step 5: Start the App

You'll need **two terminal windows** running at the same time - one for the backend and one for the frontend.

#### Terminal 1: Start the Backend

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/shoreexplorer/backend
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

**Leave this terminal running.** Don't close it.

#### Terminal 2: Start the Frontend

Open a new terminal window and run:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/shoreexplorer/frontend
yarn start
```

After a moment, you should see:
```
Compiled successfully!
You can now view shoreexplorer in the browser.
  Local: http://localhost:3000
```

**Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`.** If it doesn't, open your browser and go to that address manually.

You should now see the ShoreExplorer landing page with the headline "Make Every Port an Adventure".

## Environment Variables Explained

Here is a complete reference of every environment variable the app uses:

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

| Variable | Required | Description | Default for Local Dev |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| `MONGO_URL` | Yes | MongoDB connection string. Points to your database. Use `mongodb://localhost:27017` for local or Atlas connection string for cloud. | `mongodb://localhost:27017` |
| `DB_NAME` | Yes | Name of the MongoDB database to use. | `shoreexplorer` |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Yes | Google Gemini API key for AI plan generation. Without this, the "Generate Day Plan" feature will not work. Get it from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). | *(You must provide your own key)* |

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)

| Variable | Required | Description | Default for Local Dev |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` | Yes | The URL where the backend API is running. The frontend sends all data requests to this address. | `http://localhost:8001` |

> **Important:** Do not add quotes around the values. Write `MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017` not `MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017"`

> **Important:** Do not add comments or extra text in the `.env` files. Each line should be exactly `KEY=value`.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "MongoDB connection refused" or backend won't start
MongoDB needs to be running before you start the backend.

**Mac (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew services start mongodb-community
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

**Windows:**
MongoDB should run as a service automatically. If not, search for "Services" in the Start menu, find "MongoDB Server", and click "Start".

### "GOOGLE_API_KEY" errors or AI plan generation fails
- Double-check that your key is correct in `backend/.env`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the key
- Verify your key is valid at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- Check that you haven't exceeded the free tier limits (15 requests/minute, 1500 requests/day)

### Frontend shows a blank page
- Make sure the backend is running first (Terminal 1)
- Check that `frontend/.env` has `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001`
- If you changed the `.env` file while the frontend was running, stop the frontend (press `Ctrl+C`) and restart it with `yarn start`

### "Port already in use" error
Another programme is using port 3000 or 8001. Either:
- Close the other programme, or
- Change the port:
  - Backend: `uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002 --reload` (and update `frontend/.env` to `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8002`)
  - Frontend: `PORT=3001 yarn start`

### Map doesn't show / looks broken
The map requires an internet connection (it loads tiles from OpenStreetMap). Make sure you're connected to the internet.

### Weather shows "unavailable"
The weather API (Open-Meteo) only provides forecasts up to 16 days in the future. If your port visit date is further away, weather data won't be available yet. It will appear closer to your travel date.
